    <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) (also known as the TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons) is a men's Twenty20 (T20) cricket league that is annually held in India. The league, which was founded by the BCCI in 2007, is contested by ten city-based franchise teams.[3][4] The IPL is usually held in summer between March and May every year. It has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme, meaning fewer international cricket tours happening during IPL seasons.[5]
    </p> 
    <p>The IPL is the most popular cricket league in the world; in 2014, it was ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues.[6] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to be broadcast live on YouTube.[7][8] Other Indian sports leagues have been established based on the success of the IPL.[a][11][12][13] The brand value of the league in 2022 was ₹90,038 crore (US$11 billion).[14] According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to the GDP of the economy of India.[15] In December 2022, the IPL became a decacorn valued at US$10.9 billion, registering a 75% growth in dollar terms since 2020 when it was valued at $6.2 billion, according to a report by consulting firm D and P Advisory.[16] Its 2023 final was the most streamed live event on internet, with 32 million viewers.[17]
